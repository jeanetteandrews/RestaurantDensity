Question: If I was going to choose a hotel (or AirBnb), where should it be? What places have good amenities nearby?

Requirements:
- choose an area that has a hotel/Airbnb
- decern what are good amenities:
	- ranking/google rating/searches
		- how: scrape data, api, something else
	- we decide
		- how: take out trivial stuff like benches (although may be useful if near a park? Maybe thatâ€™s why he included them)
	- other
- decern how to choose:
	- proximity to the most amenities
		- how: ML categories, perhaps knn
	- proximity to the highest ranked amenities
		- how: ML categories, something with feature weighting
	- other
- clean data
	- depends on what you choose to do above, or we can just unpack all the tags and leave nulls
		- nulls may be easiest
